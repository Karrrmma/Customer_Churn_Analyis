# Customer_Churn_Analyis
A machine learning project using a Random Forest Classifier to identify potential customer churn in a telecom dataset, along with a mock intervention strategy to retain high-risk customers.

# Dependencies
      pandas
      scikit-learn
      pickle

# Installation
      pip install pandas scikit-learn
      
# Potential Improvements
      Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
      Use of SMOTE or class weighting for handling imbalance
      More advanced feature engineering or deep learning models
      Real email integration using SMTP (if appropriate & safe)
